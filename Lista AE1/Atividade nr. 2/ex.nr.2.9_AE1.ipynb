Therefore split the implementation up into two steps:\n","\n","* implement the gradient computation for a sample size of one\n","* implement the gradient computation for an arbitrary sample size (use the currentWeightGradients and currentBiasGradients to store the intermediate results)\n","\n","To check the results, you can verify the gradients by comparing them to PyTorch. A code copying the custom neural network PyTorch, where the automatic differentiation is provided below.\n","\n","After a sccessful verification, use the neural network to learn a function.
